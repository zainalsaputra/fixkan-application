# FixKan Application 🚀

**FixKan** is an innovative platform that empowers communities to report various public issues quickly and efficiently. With this application, users can submit reports directly from their smartphones, including photos and the exact location of the incident, enabling the relevant authorities to take immediate action.

## 📌 Why FixKan?

FixKan was created to address key challenges in public issue reporting in Indonesia, such as:

- 🚀 **Slow response** to citizen reports.
- 🔍 **Lack of transparency** in handling public complaints.
- 📢 **Limited access** for the public to the right reporting channels.

FixKan connects citizens directly with authorities or responsible institutions, ensuring that every report is not only received but also followed up with transparency and accountability.

With FixKan, we aim to foster a culture of **active civic participation** to build a safer, more comfortable, and responsive environment for everyone.
